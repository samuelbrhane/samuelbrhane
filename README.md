## 🚀 What I’m Building

### 🧠 Managed RAG Platform  
**Production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation as a Service**

A managed RAG platform where teams upload documents and instantly get a
chat application, API, and SDK — without building ingestion, indexing,
evaluation, or cost-control pipelines themselves.

**Key capabilities**
- Async ingestion for PDFs, documents, and URLs with lifecycle tracking
- Configurable chunking and embeddings stored in PostgreSQL + pgvector
- Versioned retrieval indexes with rollback and reindexing
- Streaming chat with citations, confidence signals, and “I don’t know” behavior
- Evaluation sets, regression detection, and quality dashboards
- Token usage tracking, monthly budgets, BYOK and hybrid billing modes

**Tech**  
FastAPI / Django · PostgreSQL + pgvector · Celery · S3 · Next.js · OpenAI APIs

### 🔐 AI Usage Control Platform  
**Application-level AI governance (SDK + VS Code Extension)**

A developer-first AI usage control platform that enforces limits, budgets,
and policies directly inside application code — not at the proxy or infrastructure layer.

**Key capabilities**
- Python and TypeScript SDKs wrapping LLM calls with policy enforcement
- Per-user, per-feature, and per-plan usage limits
- Per-request cost caps and budget protection
- Centralized audit logs and reasoned blocking
- VS Code extension for inspecting usage and managing policies
- BYOK support with consistent tracking across environments

**Tech**  
FastAPI · PostgreSQL · Redis · TypeScript · VS Code Extension · OpenAI APIs

### 📈 Nordict  
**Market Forecasting Platform (Founder Project)**

A production-grade forecasting platform delivering multi-horizon probabilistic
predictions (24H → 12M) with confidence scoring, alerts, and historical
forecast-vs-actual analysis.

**Key capabilities**
- Rolling inference pipelines with hourly and daily refresh cycles
- XGBoost-based time-series models with uncertainty estimation
- Authenticated dashboards for forecasts, alerts, and backtesting
- Subscription billing with plan-based feature enforcement
- AWS infrastructure deployed via Terraform and CI/CD

**Tech**  
Next.js · Django · PostgreSQL · AWS (ECS, RDS, S3, CloudFront) · Terraform

## 🧠 Core Tech Focus

### 🧩 Programming Languages
- **Python** — backend services, ML pipelines, data processing
- **TypeScript** — APIs, SDKs, frontend, VS Code extensions
- **JavaScript** — full-stack web applications
- **Go** — performance-oriented services and tooling
- **SQL** — relational data modeling and query optimization

---

### 🌐 Full-Stack & Backend Engineering
- Build and scale applications using **Django, FastAPI, Node.js, React, Next.js, Svelte**
- Design secure, high-performance **REST and GraphQL APIs**
- Architect **PostgreSQL / MySQL** databases with clean schemas and optimized queries
- Implement authentication, file handling, and real-time features using **JWT and WebSockets**
- Focus on maintainability, performance, and clear system design

---

### 🧠 Machine Learning & Data Engineering
- Develop and deploy ML/DL models with **TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn**
- Build end-to-end pipelines covering **data ingestion, training, evaluation, and inference**
- Apply **time-series forecasting, regression, and probabilistic modeling**
- Automate data workflows with **Pandas, NumPy**, and Python tooling
- Integrate ML models into backend systems and monitor experiments with **MLflow**

---

### ☁️ Cloud, DevOps & MLOps
- Architect AWS infrastructure using **EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, SageMaker**
- Deploy scalable services with **Docker and Kubernetes**
- Implement CI/CD pipelines with **GitHub Actions** and AWS-native tooling
- Design cost-aware, observable systems with logging, metrics, and alerts
- Operate production ML systems with monitoring, versioning, and rollback strategies

---

### ⚙️ What I Deliver
- End-to-end systems from idea → architecture → production deployment
- Scalable, cloud-ready, AI-powered platforms
- Clean, documented, future-proof codebases
- Clear communication and reliable execution

If you’re looking for an engineer who bridges **full-stack development,
cloud architecture, and machine learning**, I help build systems that
perform, scale, and adapt.
