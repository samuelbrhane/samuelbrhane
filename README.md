## 🚀 Flagship Projects

### 🧠 Managed RAG Platform  
**RAG-as-a-Service · Chat + API + SDK**

A production-grade RAG platform where teams upload their data and instantly get
a chat application, API, and SDK — without building ingestion, indexing,
evaluation, or cost-control pipelines.

**Key capabilities**
- Async ingestion for PDFs, documents, and URLs
- Configurable chunking & embeddings (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- Versioned retrieval indexes with rollback and reindexing
- Streaming chat with citations, confidence scores, and safe “I don’t know”
- Evaluation sets with regression detection
- Token usage tracking, budgets, BYOK & hybrid billing

**Tech stack**  
FastAPI · Django · PostgreSQL · pgvector · Celery · S3 · Next.js · OpenAI APIs

---

### 🔐 AI Usage Control Platform  
**Application-Level AI Governance · SDK + VS Code Extension**

A developer-first platform that enforces AI usage limits, budgets, and policies
directly inside application code — not at the proxy or infrastructure layer.

**Key capabilities**
- Python & TypeScript SDKs wrapping LLM calls
- Per-user, per-feature, and per-plan usage limits
- Per-request cost caps & budget protection
- Centralized audit logs with reasoned blocking
- VS Code extension for real-time visibility & policy management
- BYOK support with consistent tracking

**Tech stack**  
FastAPI · PostgreSQL · Redis · TypeScript · VS Code Extension · OpenAI APIs

---

### 📈 Nordict  
**Market Forecasting Platform (Founder Project)**

A forecasting platform delivering multi-horizon probabilistic predictions
(24H → 12M) with confidence scoring, alerts, and historical performance tracking.

**Key capabilities**
- Rolling inference pipelines (hourly & daily)
- XGBoost-based forecasting with uncertainty estimation
- Dashboards for forecasts, alerts, and backtesting
- Subscription billing with plan-based feature enforcement
- AWS infrastructure deployed with Terraform & CI/CD

**Tech stack**  
Next.js · Django · PostgreSQL · AWS (ECS, RDS, S3, CloudFront) · Terraform

## 🧠 Core Technical Focus

### 🧩 Programming Languages
- **Python** — backend systems, ML pipelines, data engineering
- **TypeScript** — APIs, SDKs, frontend, developer tooling
- **JavaScript** — full-stack web applications
- **Go** — performance-oriented services and tooling
- **SQL** — relational modeling and query optimization

---

### 🌐 Full-Stack & Backend Engineering
- Build and scale applications using **Django, FastAPI, Node.js, React, Next.js, Svelte**
- Design secure, high-performance **REST and GraphQL APIs**
- Architect **PostgreSQL / MySQL** databases with clean schemas
- Implement authentication, file handling, and real-time features using **JWT & WebSockets**
- Strong focus on maintainability, performance, and system clarity

---

### 🧠 Machine Learning & Data Engineering
- Develop and deploy ML/DL models with **TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn**
- Build end-to-end pipelines: **data → features → training → inference**
- Apply **time-series forecasting, regression, and probabilistic modeling**
- Automate data workflows with **Pandas & NumPy**
- Track experiments and models with **MLflow**

---

### ☁️ Cloud, DevOps & MLOps
- Architect AWS infrastructure using **EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, SageMaker**
- Deploy containerized services with **Docker & Kubernetes**
- Implement CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions**
- Design cost-aware, observable systems with logging, metrics, and alerts
- Operate production ML systems with versioning, monitoring, and rollback

---

### ⚙️ What I Deliver
- End-to-end systems from idea → architecture → production
- Scalable, cloud-ready, AI-powered platforms
- Clean, documented, future-proof codebases
- Clear communication and reliable execution

If you’re looking for an engineer who bridges  
**full-stack development · cloud architecture · machine learning**,  
I build systems that perform, scale, and adapt.
